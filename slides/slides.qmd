## Welcome !

### Me:

Michal Michalski

<https://topographos.github.io/>

### Lessons and Code:

<https://github.com/topographos/asar>

## Schedule

The classes will be in MCS1007, the new Maths and Science Building in Upper Mountjoy[^1].

[^1]: Fire Alarm %\>% Fire Exit %\>% Assembly Point

Practical session every Friday (11 - 13.30)

-   17th February - Intro to R and R-Spatial

-   24th February - Vector based analysis

-   3rd March - Raster based analysis

-   10th March - Vector Raster interaction

## Format

``` {.r code-line-numbers="1|2|3|4|5|6"}
# focus on learnig by doing
asar <- class_material %>% # I will prepare material for each class
  live_coding() %>%  # as in Data Carpentries
  feedback() %>% # ask questions - I will take notes
  update() %>% # I will update material and add resources
  share() # I will share it as html, pdf
```

-   classes is generally built around book [Gecomputation with R.](https://r.geocompx.org/)[^2]

-   although some additional resources are included (e.g.Intro to R)

## Assesment

``` {.r code-line-numbers="1|2|3|4|5|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14"}
# practical
assesment <- class_material %>% # you will re-use your material
  data() %>%  # I will share new data with you
  analysis() %>% # you will read, wrangle, analyse and visualize data
  report(500) %>% # You will  write a short report 
  
# score
score <- assesment %>% 
  reproducibility() %>% # the analysis should be reproducible
  folder_structure() %>% 
  style() %>% # variables names, use of space tabs
  narrative() %>%  # e.g., clear comments explaining code and workflow
  analysis() %>% # accuracy - code should work as intended
  report()  # explanation of deployed method, clear figures formatting
```

The summative deadline for project delivery will be **12pm, Monday 24th April 2023**, via Turnitin.

## Archaeological Spatial Analysis

*"The main aim of this work is to suggest to archaeologists that there is a potential for more detailed and systematic study of spatial patterning in archaeological data."*

(Hodder and Orton, 1976, p1.)

## Spatial Analysis[^3]

[^3]: 0'Sullivan D, Unwin D Geographic Information Analysis, 2010, p.2.

-   **Spatial data manipulation** - usually in GIS

-   **Spatial data analysis** - descriptive and exploratory

-   **Spatial statistical analysis** - deploy statistical methods

-   **Spatial modelling** - construct models to predict outcomes

## Why R? .Global_Env

## Why R? .Global_Env

Tool - Driven Revolution in Archaeological Science [^5]

-   ecology has moved much earlier to open programming such as R

-   archaeology have yet to adapt programming

-   we should update training curricula

-   emerging researcher in archaeology should be proficient in programming / analysis to collaborate with other domains (but not necessarily an expert in computer science)

## Why R? .Local_Env

-   It is a great resource for data analysis, data visualization, data science and machine learning
-   It provides many statistical techniques
-   It is easy to draw graphs in R, histograms, box plot etc..
-   It works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
-   It is open-source and free
-   It has a large community support
-   It has many packages (libraries of functions)

source: [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_intro.asp)

## Why R? .Local_Env

-   R integrates space and time (better than GIS)
-   seamless workflows for spatial and non-spatial analysis
-   GIS bridges
-   automation and reproducibility
-   literate programming
