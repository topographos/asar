## Archaeological Spatial Analysis in R

## ARCH43215

tutor: Michal Michalski

### Learning outcomes

The aim of this course is to introduce students to spatial data processing, analysis and visualization using R programming language. Students will learn and develop techniques to analyse data used in landscape and settlement archaeology. The course will be delivered in through live coding sessions and hands-on exercises. This class has no prerequisites.

On successful completion of the course participants will be able to:

-   Understand geospatial concepts and R's spatial capabilities

-   Read, write, and manipulate vector and raster data in R

-   Perform basic spatial analysis and visualise the results

-   Apply the tools and methods to their own projects

### Location

The classes will be in MCS1007, the new Maths and Science Building in Upper Mountjoy.
